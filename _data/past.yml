  title: "Finding Visual Patterns in Large Photo Collections for Visualization, Analytics, and Artistic Expression"
  abstract: "Our world is drowning in a data deluge, and much of this data is visual. Humanity has captured over one trillion photographs last year alone.  500 hours of video is being uploaded to YouTube every minute.   In fact, there is so much visual data out there already that much of it might never be seen by a human being! But unlike other types of 'Big Data', such as text, much of the visual content cannot be easily indexed or searched, making it Internet’s 'digital dark matter' [Perona 2010].  In this talk, I will first discuss some of the unique challenges that make visual data difficult compared to other types of content.   I will them present some of our work on navigating, visualizing, and mining for visual patterns in large-scale image collections.  Example data sources will include user-contributed Flickr photographs, Google StreetView imagery of entire cities, a hundred years of high school student portraits, and  a collection of paintings attributed to Jan Brueghel.    I will also show how recent progress in using deep learning as a way to find visual patterns and correlations could be used to synthesize novel visual content using 'image-to-image translation' paradigm.  I will conclude with examples of contemporary artists using our work as a new tool for artistic visual expression."
  bio: "Alexei A. Efros is a professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at UC Berkeley.  Prior to that, he was on the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University, and has also been a visiting scientist at École Normale Supérieure/INRIA and University of Oxford. His research is in the area of computer vision and computer graphics, especially at the intersection of the two. He is particularly interested in using data-driven techniques to tackle problems where large quantities of unlabeled visual data are readily available. Efros received his PhD in 2003 from UC Berkeley. He is a recipient of CVPR Best Paper Award (2006), NSF CAREER award (2006), Sloan Fellowship (2008), Guggenheim Fellowship (2008), SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award (2010), 3 Helmholtz Test-of-Time Prizes (1999,2003,2005), the ACM Prize in Computing (2016), and Diane McEntyre Award for Excellence in Teaching Computer Science (2019)."

  title: "Art, Ethics, and AI: Problems in the Hermeneutics of the Digital Image"
  abstract: "In the last five years, the nature of historical inquiry has undergone a radical transformation as the use of AI-enhanced search engines has become the predominant mode of knowledge investigation, consequentially affecting our engagement with images. In this system, the discovery of responses to our every question is facilitated as the vast stores of digital information that we have come to call the data universe are conjured to deliver answers that are commensurate with our human scale of comprehension, yet often exceed it. In this digital interaction it is often assumed that queries are met with complete and reliable answers, and that data is synonymous with empirical validity, despite the frequently changing structure of this mostly unsupervised repository of digital information, which in actuality projects a distortion of the physical world it represents. In this presentation, the role of vision technology and AI in navigating, analyzing, organizing, and constructing our art and art historical archives of images will be examined as a shaping force on our interpretation of the past and projection of the future. Drawing upon the observations made by Michel Foucault in The Archaeology of Knowledge that the trends toward continuity and discontinuity in descriptions of historical narratives and philosophy, respectively, are reflections of larger hermeneutic structures that in and of themselves influence knowledge formation, the question of the role of image-related data science in our humanistic interpretation of the world will be explored.
Through the examples of preservationists and artists using machine learning techniques to curate and create visual information, and in consideration of the information management needs of cultural institutions, the machine-learned image will be posited as a new and radical phenomenon of our society that is altering the nature of historical interpretation itself. By extension, this presentation brings renewed attention to aesthetic theory and calls for a new philosophical paradigm of visual perception to be employed for the analysis and management of our visual culture and heritage in the age of AI, one which incorporates and actively partakes in the development of computer vision-based technologies.
